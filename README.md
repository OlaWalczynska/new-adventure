# new-adventure
My first repository

Szymek was here

#This is my first trial with github
##I am going to **use it** for
*co-operate within my own project
*cooperate with other people within their projects
* and who knows what is more

##I will also share this new knowledge with my collaborators

I see it is so much better than just sharing files throught *dropbox*

### Gosia was here ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
# I overslept and did not have m my tea today, can you tell?
